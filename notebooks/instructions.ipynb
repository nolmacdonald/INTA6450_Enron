    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to implement some kind of approach to filter through emails to identify the ones that are associated with your specific form of wrongdoing. You may choose to use methods from the course if you like but you do not need to. The most important part of a good project is that you have a clear type of wrongdoing laid out and that you can show that your methods do as good a job as possible at leading to emails that show your type of wrongdoing. The result of this project should be your identified emails that match your pattern and constitute evidence of your defined wrongdoing. You will be assessed on your ability to implement your project as well as how well your approach is appropriate for your definition of wrongdoing. "

    "\n",
    "1. You will be placed in a small group of four.  You may form your own groups if you like, but we will send out a survey early in the class to help make sure groups have people of different academic backgrounds but similar timezones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within your group, implement a strategy. It might or might not be the same as one of the strategies outlined in your individual Part 1 proposal. You may use the Python notebook at [data access page] as a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find Top 5 emails representing signs of “wrongdoing”. It doesn't have to be exactly 5, but it almost certainly shouldn't be 50 and definitely shouldn't be 500!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Document how your strategy got your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a 10 to 30-page paper, including appendixes/emails, that articulates the group’s wrongdoing target. The target doesn’t have to be the same as your proposal. The large range here is so that it can be OK to include differing amounts of long chunks of code or charts or email texts depending on your particular project choices.\n",
    "    - Start with your definition of wrongdoing \n",
    "    - Indicate the strategy you used to find emails \n",
    "    - What is your set of emails that indicated wrongdoing?  \n",
    "    - Was your set of emails good? Why or why not? \n",
    "    - What problems would you fix next time? \n",
    "    - What problems are unfixable about this approach? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Assign one member of your group to submit the assignment to the appropriate section in Canvas."
